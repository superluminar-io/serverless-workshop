# Serverless Workshop

## Welcome

This workshop is designed to give you an overview of serverless development with AWS. We will create a REST API with Amazon API Gateway, Lambda and DynamoDB. After creating the API, we will break the system in an interactive GameDay session and try to identify best practices and antipatterns along the way.

Let's get started! ðŸ¤©

## Architecture Diagram

The API enables us to create the next awesome notes app. With two routes in place, we can create a new note and list all notes. For both routes, we call Lambda functions and persist our data in a DynamoDB table.

## Prerequisites

We prepared individual playground accounts for every attendee. Please go to the [AWS SSO login page](https://fielmann-sso.awsapps.com/start/#/), click on **AWS Account** and search for **playground-$YOUR_NAME**. Click on the account name to collapse the details and then click on **Management console**. This should open the AWS console for your account.

All step-by-step guides are written in English, we recommend selecting _English (US)_ as the language for the AWS console. You find the option in the footer of the console.
