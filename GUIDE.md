# Trainer's Guide

## About this document

The trainer's guide provides guidance on how to plan, prepare, and give the serverless workshop. The document assumes the serverless workshop takes place remotely.

## Before the workshop

### Invitation

Right after the assignment, we write an email to the event organizer to clarify a few things and prepare the invitation for the attendees. 

What we need to check:
- Are Google Meet and Miro okay in your organisation or do we need to consider something?
- Shall we provide AWS accounts for the attendees, or do you provide them? An ideal scenario would be individual playground accounts per attendee, but we can also manage them in one AWS account. Either way, the attendees need admin rights.
- Shall we invite the attendees, or do you create a calendar invitation? If we invite them, please provide the list of attendees.

Template for the email:

Hi [name], 

my name is [name], and I will be your trainer for the serverless workshop. My colleague [name] joins me.

Before the workshop, we need to check a few things with you:

1. We use some online tools during the workshop to create a lively remote experience. Are Google Meet and Miro okay in your organization, or do we need to consider something?

2. For the hands-on sessions, we use AWS accounts to provision infrastructure and play around in the AWS management console. Shall we provide AWS accounts for the attendees, or do you provide them? An ideal scenario would be individual playground accounts per attendee, but we can also manage them in one AWS account. Either way, the attendees need admin rights.

3. Shall we invite the attendees, or do you send out a calendar invitation? We usually schedule a meeting from 9am to 5pm CE(S)T. Is that okay for you? Could you please provide the list of attendees?

I am looking forward to hearing from you. 

Best, 

[name]

Template for the calendar invitation:

Hello everyone, 

my name is [name] and I am your trainer for the serverless workshop. My colleague [name] joins me. We are both Cloud Consultants with years of experience with AWS.

The event will take place remotely. Please join the session by clicking on the Google Meet link attached to this invitation.

At the beginning of the workshop, we will give a short introduction to serverless technologies but our main focus will be hands-on sessions with you. Therefore, we need to prepare our computers and install some tools. You can find the list below. Don’t worry if you can’t prepare your computer, we can also find alternatives with cloud-based IDEs. 

Prerequisites:

- IDE (e.g. VS Code)
- Terminal (e.g. iTerm or Integrated Terminal in VS Code)
- Node.js (v16)
- AWS CLI

If you have questions or problems with the setup, don’t hesitate to write me an e-mail (henrik.fricke@superluminar.io). 

See you in [X] weeks,

[name]
```

### Meeting w/ organizer

One week before the workshop, we schedule an informal 30-minutes meeting with the organizer. 

We can use the meeting to:
- Talk about the workshop agenda, the labs, and the Miro board
- Discuss open questions
- Get to know each other
- Double-check everything (like the AWS accounts)

### Quick reminder right before the workshop

One day before the workshop, we send a quick reminder to the attendees. 

Template for the email:

```txt
Hello everyone, 

tomorrow is our serverless workshop. The event will take place remotely. Please join the session by clicking on the Google Meet link attached to the calendar invitation.

To get the most out of the workshop, we recommend to prepare your computer and install some tools. We will use the tools to deploy and update infrastructure directly from our computers.

Prerequisites:
- IDE (e.g. VS Code)
- Terminal (e.g. iTerm or Integrated Terminal in VS Code)
- Node.js (v16)
- AWS CLI

Don’t worry if you can’t prepare your computer, we can also find alternatives with cloud-based IDEs.

See you tomorrow, 

[name]
